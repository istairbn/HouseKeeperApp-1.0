#Config.properties for HouseKeeperApp-1.0
#For all paths, You MUST use forward slashes, even if it is a Windows Path, because Java Properties method escapes back slashes. 
#Targets: These are the paths you want monitored. Add targets as a JSON string { "Nickname1":"PathtoFolder1","Nickname2":"PathtoFolder2"}
#extensions: What files you want cleaned. It searches the whole file name, so any pattern will work. Default is . (all names with a . in it)
#timelimit = How many minutes old since last modified before it should be deleted. 60 is an hour for example. Default is 24 hours
#Recursion. true (lower case) means this will recurse through all folders. Anything else or a blank is false (Recursion is dangerous, must be explicit)
